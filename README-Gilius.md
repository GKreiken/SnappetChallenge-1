# Snappet challenge - Gilius Kreiken

## Introduction

Gentlemen ðŸŽ©

First of all thank you for the invitation to work on this challenge.
When I read the challenge description I admit I got rather excited.
Mental images quickly came to mind on how I wanted to present it, and also
some immediate [challenges](#challenges) were clear.

In order to convey my train of thought as clearly as possible I kept
a [diary](#diary) on the work. In your challenge description you
mentioned it's not worth spending a disproportionate amount of time
on the challenge as it functions solely as a format to induce
conversation. Seeing as I would like to present a working/finished
product and I'm excited to tackle the challenges presented, I leave
it up to you to decide wether the time invested was disproportionate
or not :)

## Firing up the app

Assuming you have `npm` installed and an internet connection, you can run the following commands to start the app:

`npm i`
`npm run client:start`

## Goals

- [ ] Check data set & draw out design to match assignment
- [ ] Create an Express app to fetch data from the needed date
- [ ] Create React front-end

## Possible challenges / gotya's

- Might take some time to refamiliarize myself with Express
as my work so far has been mostly front-end orientated.
- Data set = big(ish). I expect some smart data fetching is needed,
seeing as using a simple `.filter()` will slow down the app.
This is completely new to me.
- Check wether the UTC makes is a gotya
(i.e. if a student did some work in the last hour of a day)
